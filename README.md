## Controller w/flex sensors

To send action from arduino to pc we decided to use a library called XDO that allow to send both mouse and keyboard signal.
To interact with users we have written a shell with every command that can be usefull to ineract with the controller 

To launch the shell go to sw_pc folder in program folder and digit "./ghost".
Be shure that arduino was connected to your pc and that the dedicated code has been uploaded to it.

For more command and how to use them digit "help" or "h" in shell
